Get User Agents In Python

#### python -m venv env

#### source env/bin/activate

#### pip install requests

#### pip install fake-useragent


You can get a list of user agents from various online resources or libraries that provide such information. Here's one way to fetch a list of user agents using the fake-useragent library:

First, you need to install the fake-useragent library using pip:


pip install fake-useragent
Then, you can use the library to fetch a list of user agents in your Python script:


from fake_useragent import UserAgent

# Instantiate the UserAgent object
ua = UserAgent()

# Get a random user agent
random_user_agent = ua.random

# Get a list of all user agents
all_user_agents = ua.data_browsers

print("Random User Agent:", random_user_agent)
print("\nAll User Agents:", all_user_agents)
In this script:

We import the UserAgent class from the fake_useragent module.
We instantiate the UserAgent object.
You can then get a random user agent by calling the random attribute of the UserAgent object.
You can also get a list of all user agents available by accessing the data_browsers attribute.
This approach allows you to dynamically fetch a list of user agents that you can use in your requests. Keep in mind that using a random user agent may not always be suitable for your needs, as some websites may block requests from unknown or unusual user agents. Always ensure that you comply with the terms of service of the website you are scraping and use appropriate user agents.


## NB: It works in virtual environment
